# *First Post!*

`I successfully got markdown rendering in react!`

Super easy using [marked-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/marked-react)

I'm thinking of adding a tool so I can easily post blogs since I have to edit two spots.
1. The database.
2. The blogs file on 'Butterfly'

Not sure yet. If I added that functionality to the site then I would have to add some auth
here and that seems like a pain. Maybe would be easier to just have an app on the server?

Either way this is done and I can move onto categorizing the blogs and allowing the filter buttons
on the homepage to work.

I was also thinking of moving the card list to the database. That way I can upload new cards to my
collection without having to rebuild the site.

Here is an image so I can see if this renders!
