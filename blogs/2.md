# Game Hacking Ep. 1 - Stardew Valley
Nicholas N Ryan | April 12th, 2023

## Intro
So... I have been playing a TON of <code>CounterStrike: GO</code> recently. And after encountering people I suspect of cheating, I have had this bug inside my head. I keep thinking, How hard is Videogame Hacking anyways???

Turns out. Very.

## Where I started
I have no interest in cheating in competitive games. Since the feeling of skill/progression is where I get 90% of my enjoyment from. But... I'm a hacker. So I need to break something! This is where <code>Stardew Valley</code> enters. Thank you to [Eric Barone](https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe) for this amazing game!

### Minecraft
My entire knowledge of Videogame hacking is contained in this quote from Socrates.

But I used to watch these guys who played minecraft back when I was 13.. [Team AVO!](https://www.youtube.com/@teamavolition)

They used to use keybinds/chat commands in minecraft to initiate hacked functionality. Stardew Valley also has chat and commands to Pause the game and such in multiplayer. So my first idea, is I can add commands to Stardew to initiate cheats!

## How do I inject code??
After a quick google search. <code>what language is stardew valley written in</code> I see the result,
<pre><code>
As I mentioned in my other response to this question, (here)
Stardew Valley was written in C#, using XNA, and Visual Studio 2010.
</code></pre>

Cool, so where do I go from here? I have experience reversing malware using Ghidra. But some digging around pointed me to a tool called [dnSpy](https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy). Which can edit .NET assemblies, nice!

After investigating Stardew Valley's directory structure there is a ton of dll files. But there is two particular files that interest me, <code>Stardew Valley.exe</code> and <code>Stardew Valley.dll</code> I assume these are the entry for the program. So I loaded up dnSpy and tried to open <code>Stardew Valley.exe</code>. Which gets me a whole lotta nothing.

I don't see any C# code here, but when I load <code>Stardew Valley.dll</code>:

![svdll](../imgs/svdll.png)

Eureka! I have found code! After some digging around in the source, I continue on with my idea of adding commands. I find <code>StardewValley.Menus -> class ChatBox</code> Inside of this class there is a function called <code>runCommand</code>, which handles the arguments and string parsing for commands! Inside this method there is a large switch statement with each command, but a couple peak my interest.

There are cheat commands built in? So I searched further and the "money" command calls a function called <code>cheat</code>, which eventually calls <code>parseDebugInput in Game1.cs</code>.
There are debug cheats built into the game!

## Enabling cheats
Looking at the <code>runCommand</code> method, cheat commands must pass a check for the boolean <code>enableCheats</code> This variable is set in the <code>ChatBox</code> class constructor. Simply changing this variable to true. Which is super easy in dnSpy by right clicking the constructor and editing the method. After making this change to <code>Stardew Valley.dll</code> I can simply run the game and all the cheat commands outlined in <code>Game1.cs</code> is accessible.

Here is me spawning in an iridium leek day 4 using the <code>itemname</code> command.

## Conclusion
Stardew Valley has been officially broken. This was extremely simple only because of dnSpy. Editing .NET dlls is made extremely easy! There was no need for me to dig deeper at the code to manipulate map/player data since there is every cheat a user would need to debug built in. Teleportation, Money manipulation, Item spawning, Time changing, Instant growing, etc...

My first excersion into game hacking was very fun. Next up is an early access game I have been having a ton of fun playing. [Core Keeper](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1621690/Core_Keeper/)
